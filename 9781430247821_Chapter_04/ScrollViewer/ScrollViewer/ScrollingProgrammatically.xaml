                <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource MyTextBlockStyle}">
        One thing was certain, that the WHITE kitten had had nothing to do with 
        it:—it was the black kitten's fault entirely. For the white kitten had 
        been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an 
        hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it COULDN'T 
        have had any hand in the mischief.</TextBlock>

                <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource MyTextBlockStyle}">
        The way Dinah washed her children's faces was this: first she held the poor 
        thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she rubbed 
        its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and just now, as I 
        said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was lying quite still 
        and trying to purr—no doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good.</TextBlock>

                <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource MyTextBlockStyle}">
        But the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon, and so, 
        while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great arm-chair, half 
        talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been having a grand game of 
        romps with the ball of worsted Alice had been trying to wind up, and had been 
        rolling it up and down till it had all come undone again; and there it was, 
        spread over the hearth-rug, all knots and tangles, with the kitten running 
        after its own tail in the middle.</TextBlock>

                <TextBlock x:Name="LastParagraphTextBox" Style="{StaticResource MyTextBlockStyle}">
        'Oh, you wicked little thing!' cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and giving 
            it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace. 'Really, Dinah 
            ought to have taught you better manners! You OUGHT, Dinah, you know you ought!' 
            she added, looking reproachfully at the old cat, and speaking in as cross a 
            voice as she could manage—and then she scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking 
            the kitten and the worsted with her, and began winding up the ball again. But 
            she didn't get on very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the 
            kitten, and sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, 
            pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one 
            paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it might.
